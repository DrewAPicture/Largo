Writing Posts
=============

Formatting Within Posts
-----------------------

After you have entered the text for your post you are able to create asides and pull quotes as well as add media to your post.

**Module Wrapper**

Within in the body copy box, using the visual editor you can access the module wrapper options by clicking on the icon furthest to the right.

The module wrapper enables you to make a selection of text appear as an aside or a pull out quote.


**Add Media**

The Add Media button above the body copy box allows you to upload images and insert images of various sizes into posts.


**Featured Media**

The Set Featured Media button is located above the body copy box.

In this window you can select featured media: embed code, video, image or gallery of images to appear in the hero section at the top of the article.
The featured media may also appear on the homepage (see Post Prominence below).


Other Post Options
------------------

After you are finished with the body of the post, there are a number of additional options to consider.


On the right sidebar of the Post Edit Screen you will find:

**Taxonomies**

The taxonomies activated by default include Categories, Tags and Post Prominence. Additional there are two optional taxonomies (Series and Post Types) that are enabled through the Appearance > Theme Options > Advanced menu. More about taxonomies http://largo.readthedocs.org/users/taxonomies.html


**Related Posts**

Managed by the Largo Related Posts Widget
Show related posts that are either editorially determined (by adding related post IDs in the Additional Options box of the post edit screen) or using a default related algorithm that tries to surface the most closely-related post(s) to a given post by series, category or tag.

To override the default related posts functionality enter specific related post IDs separated by commas.

To find the post id, from the post menu, click on the post you are looking to identify.
http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1280&action=edit
The Post ID  is 1280.


**Top Term**

From a pulldown menu (populated by categories and tags) Identify which of the post's terms is primary. This is used a navigational aid in many homepage layouts and appears directly above the headline on the single article template.


**Custom Byline Options**

The recommended author options include: Creating a WordPress account for each author, or  if you need to include co-authors, activate the Co-Authors plug in.  More plugin information http://largo.readthedocs.org/users/plugins.html

In rare instances you can enter plain text to override the byline by entering the text of the byline as you want it to appear and where you would like it to link to (because WordPress will not automatically create an author archive page as it does for regular users) into the custom byline text and byline link boxes.


**Layout Options**

The default post template since Largo 0.4 is the One Column (Standard) layout. In this box you are able to modify the template on a per-post basis by selecting another option.

**Custom Sidebar**

The default (single column) post layout does not include a sidebar. If you select a sidebar from this dropdown menu it will be displayed as a skinny column directly to the left of the post beginning below the hero image.

For the two column post template, the sidebar is displayed to the right of the main post content.


**Sticky Footer**

The sticky footer at the bottom of the post in Largo 0.4 displays share icons for Twitter, Facebook and email on the left and follow on the the right with links to other stories in the same category or written by the same author. You can toggle the option to display the various social networks from the Appearance > Theme Options menu.
